            effects:
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Forward movement:</strong> The value of

            An ATN transition between any two ATN states.  Subclasses define
            atom, set, epsilon, action, predicate, rule transitions.
            <p>This is a one way link.  It emanates from a state (usually via a list of
            transitions) and has a target state.</p>
            <p>Since we never have to change the ATN transitions once we construct it,
            we can fix these transitions as specific classes. The DFA transitions
            on the other hand need to update the labels as it adds transitions to
            the states. We'll use the term Edge for the DFA to distinguish them from
            ATN transitions.</p>

            <p>We track these variables separately for the DFA and ATN simulation

            <summary>The embodiment of the adaptive LL(*), ALL(*), parsing strategy.</summary>
            <remarks>
            The embodiment of the adaptive LL(*), ALL(*), parsing strategy.
            <p>
            The basic complexity of the adaptive strategy makes it harder to understand.
            We begin with ATN simulation to build paths in a DFA. Subsequent prediction
            requests go through the DFA first. If they reach a state without an edge for
            the current symbol, the algorithm fails over to the ATN simulation to
            complete the DFA path for the current input (until it finds a conflict state
            or uniquely predicting state).</p>
            <p>
            All of that is done without using the outer context because we want to create
            a DFA that is not dependent upon the rule invocation stack when we do a
            prediction. One DFA works in all contexts. We avoid using context not
            necessarily because it's slower, although it can be, but because of the DFA
            caching problem. The closure routine only considers the rule invocation stack
            created during prediction beginning in the decision rule. For example, if
            prediction occurs without invoking another rule's ATN, there are no context
            stacks in the configurations. When lack of context leads to a conflict, we
            don't know if it's an ambiguity or a weakness in the strong LL(*) parsing
            strategy (versus full LL(*)).</p>
            <p>
            When SLL yields a configuration set with conflict, we rewind the input and
            retry the ATN simulation, this time using full outer context without adding
            to the DFA. Configuration context stacks will be the full invocation stacks
            from the start rule. If we get a conflict using full context, then we can
            definitively say we have a true ambiguity for that input sequence. If we
            don't get a conflict, it implies that the decision is sensitive to the outer
            context. (It is not context-sensitive in the sense of context-sensitive
            grammars.)</p>
            <p>
            The next time we reach this DFA state with an SLL conflict, through DFA
            simulation, we will again retry the ATN simulation using full context mode.
            This is slow because we can't save the results and have to "interpret" the
            ATN each time we get that input.</p>
            <p>
            <strong>CACHING FULL CONTEXT PREDICTIONS</strong></p>
            <p>
            We could cache results from full context to predicted alternative easily and
            that saves a lot of time but doesn't work in presence of predicates. The set
            of visible predicates from the ATN start state changes depending on the
            context, because closure can fall off the end of a rule. I tried to cache
            tuples (stack context, semantic context, predicted alt) but it was slower
            than interpreting and much more complicated. Also required a huge amount of
            memory. The goal is not to create the world's fastest parser anyway. I'd like
            to keep this algorithm simple. By launching multiple threads, we can improve
            the speed of parsing across a large number of files.</p>
            <p>
            There is no strict ordering between the amount of input used by SLL vs LL,
            which makes it really hard to build a cache for full context. Let's say that
            we have input A B C that leads to an SLL conflict with full context X. That
            implies that using X we might only use A B but we could also use A B C D to
            resolve conflict. Input A B C D could predict alternative 1 in one position
            in the input and A B C E could predict alternative 2 in another position in
            input. The conflicting SLL configurations could still be non-unique in the
            full context prediction, which would lead us to requiring more input than the
            original A B C.	To make a	prediction cache work, we have to track	the exact
            input	used during the previous prediction. That amounts to a cache that maps
            X to a specific DFA for that context.</p>
            <p>
            Something should be done for left-recursive expression predictions. They are
            likely LL(1) + pred eval. Easier to do the whole SLL unless error and retry
            with full LL thing Sam does.</p>
            <p>
            <strong>AVOIDING FULL CONTEXT PREDICTION</strong></p>
            <p>
            We avoid doing full context retry when the outer context is empty, we did not
            dip into the outer context by falling off the end of the decision state rule,
            or when we force SLL mode.</p>
            <p>
            As an example of the not dip into outer context case, consider as super
            constructor calls versus function calls. One grammar might look like
            this:</p>
            <pre>
            ctorBody
            : '{' superCall? stat* '}'
            ;
            </pre>
            <p>
            Or, you might see something like</p>
            <pre>
            stat
            : superCall ';'
            | expression ';'
            | ...
            ;
            </pre>
            <p>
            In both cases I believe that no closure operations will dip into the outer
            context. In the first case ctorBody in the worst case will stop at the '}'.
            In the 2nd case it should stop at the ';'. Both cases should stay within the
            entry rule and not dip into the outer context.</p>
            <p>
            <strong>PREDICATES</strong></p>
            <p>
            Predicates are always evaluated if present in either SLL or LL both. SLL and
            LL simulation deals with predicates differently. SLL collects predicates as
            it performs closure operations like ANTLR v3 did. It delays predicate
            evaluation until it reaches and accept state. This allows us to cache the SLL
            ATN simulation whereas, if we had evaluated predicates on-the-fly during
            closure, the DFA state configuration sets would be different and we couldn't
            build up a suitable DFA.</p>
            <p>
            When building a DFA accept state during ATN simulation, we evaluate any
            predicates and return the sole semantically valid alternative. If there is
            more than 1 alternative, we report an ambiguity. If there are 0 alternatives,
            we throw an exception. Alternatives without predicates act like they have
            true predicates. The simple way to think about it is to strip away all
            alternatives with false predicates and choose the minimum alternative that
            remains.</p>
            <p>
            When we start in the DFA and reach an accept state that's predicated, we test
            those and return the minimum semantically viable alternative. If no
            alternatives are viable, we throw an exception.</p>
            <p>
            During full LL ATN simulation, closure always evaluates predicates and
            on-the-fly. This is crucial to reducing the configuration set size during
            closure. It hits a landmine when parsing with the Java grammar, for example,
            without this on-the-fly evaluation.</p>
            <p>
            <strong>SHARING DFA</strong></p>
            <p>
            All instances of the same parser share the same decision DFAs through a
            static field. Each instance gets its own ATN simulator but they share the
            same
            <see cref="F:Antlr4.Runtime.Atn.ATN.decisionToDFA">ATN.decisionToDFA</see>
            field. They also share a
            <see cref="T:Antlr4.Runtime.Atn.PredictionContextCache">PredictionContextCache</see>
            object that makes sure that all
            <see cref="T:Antlr4.Runtime.Atn.PredictionContext">PredictionContext</see>
            objects are shared among the DFA states. This makes
            a big size difference.</p>

            <see cref="M:Antlr4.Runtime.Atn.ParserATNSimulator.AddDFAState(Antlr4.Runtime.Dfa.DFA,Antlr4.Runtime.Atn.ATNConfigSet,Antlr4.Runtime.Atn.PredictionContextCache)">AddDFAState(Antlr4.Runtime.Dfa.DFA, ATNConfigSet, PredictionContextCache)</see>
            locks on
            the DFA for the current decision when looking up a DFA state to see if it
            already exists. We must make sure that all requests to add DFA states that
            are equivalent result in the same shared DFA object. This is because lots of
            threads will be trying to update the DFA at once. The
            <see cref="M:Antlr4.Runtime.Atn.ParserATNSimulator.AddDFAState(Antlr4.Runtime.Dfa.DFA,Antlr4.Runtime.Atn.ATNConfigSet,Antlr4.Runtime.Atn.PredictionContextCache)">AddDFAState(Antlr4.Runtime.Dfa.DFA, ATNConfigSet, PredictionContextCache)</see>
            method also locks inside the DFA lock
            but this time on the shared context cache when it rebuilds the
            configurations'
            <see cref="T:Antlr4.Runtime.Atn.PredictionContext">PredictionContext</see>
            objects using cached
            subgraphs/nodes. No other locking occurs, even during DFA simulation. This is
            safe as long as we can guarantee that all threads referencing
            <code>s.edge[t]</code>
            get the same physical target
            <see cref="T:Antlr4.Runtime.Dfa.DFAState">Antlr4.Runtime.Dfa.DFAState</see>
            , or
            <code>null</code>
            . Once into the DFA, the DFA simulation does not reference the
            <see cref="F:Antlr4.Runtime.Dfa.DFA.states">Antlr4.Runtime.Dfa.DFA.states</see>
            map. It follows the
            <see cref="!:DFAState#edges">DFAState#edges</see>
            field to new
            targets. The DFA simulator will either find

            <code>null</code>

            null, or

            If it does not get a syntax error, then we're done. If it does get a syntax
            error, we need to retry with the combined SLL/LL strategy.</p>
            <p>
            The reason this works is as follows. If there are no SLL conflicts, then the
            grammar is SLL (at least for that input set). If there is an SLL conflict,
            the full LL analysis must yield a set of viable alternatives which is a
            subset of the alternatives reported by SLL. If the LL set is a singleton,
            then the grammar is LL but not SLL. If the LL set is the same size as the SLL
            set, the decision is SLL. If the LL set has size &gt; 1, then that decision
            is truly ambiguous on the current input. If the LL set is smaller, then the
            SLL conflict resolution might choose an alternative that the full LL would
            rule out as a possibility based upon better context information. If that's
            the case, then the SLL parse will definitely get an error because the full LL
            analysis says it's not viable. If SLL conflict resolution chooses an
            alternative within the LL set, them both SLL and LL would choose the same
            alternative because they both choose the minimum of multiple conflicting
            alternatives.</p>
            <p>
            Let's say we have a set of SLL conflicting alternatives
            <code></code>
            
            1, 2, 3}} and
            a smaller LL set called <em>s</em>. If <em>s</em> is
            <code></code>
            
            2, 3}}, then SLL
            parsing will get an error because SLL will pursue alternative 1. If
            <em>s</em> is
            <code></code>
            
            1, 2}} or
            <code></code>
            
            1, 3}} then both SLL and LL will
            choose the same alternative because alternative one is the minimum of either
            set. If <em>s</em> is
            <code></code>
            
            2}} or
            <code></code>
            
            3}} then SLL will get a syntax
            error. If <em>s</em> is
            <code></code>
            
            1}} then SLL will succeed.</p>
            <p>
            Of course, if the input is invalid, then we will get an error for sure in
            both SLL and LL parsing. Erroneous input will therefore require 2 passes over
            the input.</p>

            having to traverse the ATN again for the same input sequence.
            There are some key conditions we're looking for after computing a new
            set of ATN configs (proposed DFA state):
            if the set is empty, there is no viable alternative for current symbol
            does the state uniquely predict an alternative?
            does the state have a conflict that would prevent us from
            putting it on the work list?
            if in non-greedy decision is there a config at a rule stop state?
            We also have some key operations to do:
            add an edge from previous DFA state to potentially new DFA state, D,
            upon current symbol but only if adding to work list, which means in all
            cases except no viable alternative (and possibly non-greedy decisions?)
            collecting predicates and adding semantic context to DFA accept states
            adding rule context to context-sensitive DFA accept states
            consuming an input symbol
            reporting a conflict
            reporting an ambiguity
            reporting a context sensitivity
            reporting insufficient predicates
            We should isolate those operations, which are side-effecting, to the
            main work loop. We can isolate lots of code into other functions, but
            they should be side effect free. They can return package that
            indicates whether we should report something, whether we need to add a
            DFA edge, whether we need to augment accept state with semantic
            context or rule invocation context. Actually, it seems like we always
            add predicates if they exist, so that can simply be done in the main
            loop for any accept state creation or modification request.

            blocked by a semantic predicate. By choosing this alternative within

            decision rule, which helps developers identify and correct logic errors

            <remarks>
            The SLL(*) prediction mode. This prediction mode ignores the current
            parser context when making predictions. This is the fastest prediction
            mode, and provides correct results for many grammars. This prediction
            mode is more powerful than the prediction mode provided by ANTLR 3, but
            may result in syntax errors for grammar and input combinations which are
            not SLL.
            <p>
            When using this prediction mode, the parser will either return a correct
            parse tree (i.e. the same parse tree that would be returned with the
            <see cref="F:Antlr4.Runtime.Atn.PredictionMode.Ll">Ll</see>
            prediction mode), or it will report a syntax error. If a

            <see cref="F:Antlr4.Runtime.Atn.PredictionMode.Sll">Sll</see>
            prediction mode,
            it may be due to either an actual syntax error in the input or indicate

            The LL(*) prediction mode. This prediction mode allows the current parser
            context to be used for resolving SLL conflicts that occur during
            prediction. This is the fastest prediction mode that guarantees correct
            parse results for all combinations of grammars with syntactically correct
            inputs.
            <p>
            When using this prediction mode, the parser will make correct decisions
            for all syntactically-correct grammar and input combinations. However, in
            cases where the grammar is truly ambiguous this prediction mode might not

            <remarks>
            The LL(*) prediction mode with exact ambiguity detection. In addition to
            the correctness guarantees provided by the
            <see cref="F:Antlr4.Runtime.Atn.PredictionMode.Ll">Ll</see>
            prediction mode,
            this prediction mode instructs the prediction algorithm to determine the
            complete and exact set of ambiguous alternatives for every ambiguous
            decision encountered while parsing.
            <p>
            This prediction mode may be used for diagnosing ambiguities during
            grammar development. Due to the performance overhead of calculating sets
            of ambiguous alternatives, this prediction mode should be avoided when
            the exact results are not necessary.</p>
            <p>
            This prediction mode does not provide any guarantees for prediction
            behavior for syntactically-incorrect inputs.</p>

            <summary>Computes the SLL prediction termination condition.</summary>
            <remarks>
            Computes the SLL prediction termination condition.
            <p>
            This method computes the SLL prediction termination condition for both of
            the following cases.</p>
            <ul>
            <li>The usual SLL+LL fallback upon SLL conflict</li>
            <li>Pure SLL without LL fallback</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>COMBINED SLL+LL PARSING</strong></p>
            <p>When LL-fallback is enabled upon SLL conflict, correct predictions are
            ensured regardless of how the termination condition is computed by this
            method. Due to the substantially higher cost of LL prediction, the
            prediction should only fall back to LL when the additional lookahead
            cannot lead to a unique SLL prediction.</p>
            <p>Assuming combined SLL+LL parsing, an SLL configuration set with only
            conflicting subsets should fall back to full LL, even if the
            configuration sets don't resolve to the same alternative (e.g.
            <code></code>
            
            1,2}} and
            <code></code>
            
            3,4}}. If there is at least one non-conflicting
            configuration, SLL could continue with the hopes that more lookahead will
            resolve via one of those non-conflicting configurations.</p>
            <p>Here's the prediction termination rule them: SLL (for SLL+LL parsing)
            stops when it sees only conflicting configuration subsets. In contrast,
            full LL keeps going when there is uncertainty.</p>
            <p><strong>HEURISTIC</strong></p>
            <p>As a heuristic, we stop prediction when we see any conflicting subset
            unless we see a state that only has one alternative associated with it.
            The single-alt-state thing lets prediction continue upon rules like
            (otherwise, it would admit defeat too soon):</p>
            <p>
            <code>[12|1|[], 6|2|[], 12|2|[]]. s : (ID | ID ID?) ';' ;</code>
            </p>
            <p>When the ATN simulation reaches the state before
            <code>';'</code>
            , it has a
            DFA state that looks like:
            <code>[12|1|[], 6|2|[], 12|2|[]]</code>
            . Naturally
            <code>12|1|[]</code>
            and
            <code>12|2|[]</code>
            conflict, but we cannot stop
            processing this node because alternative to has another way to continue,
            via
            <code>[6|2|[]]</code>
            .</p>
            <p>It also let's us continue for this rule:</p>
            <p>
            <code>[1|1|[], 1|2|[], 8|3|[]] a : A | A | A B ;</code>
            </p>
            <p>After matching input A, we reach the stop state for rule A, state 1.
            State 8 is the state right before B. Clearly alternatives 1 and 2
            conflict and no amount of further lookahead will separate the two.
            However, alternative 3 will be able to continue and so we do not stop
            working on this state. In the previous example, we're concerned with
            states associated with the conflicting alternatives. Here alt 3 is not
            associated with the conflicting configs, but since we can continue
            looking for input reasonably, don't declare the state done.</p>
            <p><strong>PURE SLL PARSING</strong></p>
            <p>To handle pure SLL parsing, all we have to do is make sure that we
            combine stack contexts for configurations that differ only by semantic
            predicate. From there, we can do the usual SLL termination heuristic.</p>
            <p><strong>PREDICATES IN SLL+LL PARSING</strong></p>
            <p>SLL decisions don't evaluate predicates until after they reach DFA stop
            states because they need to create the DFA cache that works in all
            semantic situations. In contrast, full LL evaluates predicates collected
            during start state computation so it can ignore predicates thereafter.
            This means that SLL termination detection can totally ignore semantic
            predicates.</p>
            <p>Implementation-wise,
            <see cref="T:Antlr4.Runtime.Atn.ATNConfigSet">ATNConfigSet</see>
            combines stack contexts but not
            semantic predicate contexts so we might see two configurations like the
            following.</p>
            <p>
            <code></code>
            (s, 1, x,
            ), (s, 1, x', {p})}</p>
            <p>Before testing these configurations against others, we have to merge
            <code>x</code>
            and
            <code>x'</code>
            (without modifying the existing configurations).
            For example, we test
            <code>(x+x')==x''</code>
            when looking for conflicts in
            the following configurations.</p>
            <p>
            <code></code>
            (s, 1, x,
            ), (s, 1, x', {p}), (s, 2, x'', {})}</p>
            <p>If the configuration set has predicates (as indicated by
            <see cref="P:Antlr4.Runtime.Atn.ATNConfigSet.HasSemanticContext">ATNConfigSet.HasSemanticContext()</see>
            ), this algorithm makes a copy of
            the configurations to strip out all of the predicates so that a standard
            <see cref="T:Antlr4.Runtime.Atn.ATNConfigSet">ATNConfigSet</see>
            will merge everything ignoring predicates.</p>

            <remarks>
            For context independent predicates, we evaluate them without a local
            context (i.e., null context). That way, we can evaluate them without
            having to create proper rule-specific context during prediction (as
            opposed to the parser, which creates them naturally). In a practical
            sense, this avoids a cast exception from RuleContext to myruleContext.
            <p>For context dependent predicates, we must pass in a local context so that
            references such as $arg evaluate properly as _localctx.arg. We only
            capture context dependent predicates in the context in which we begin
            prediction, so we passed in the outer context here in case of context
            dependent predicate evaluation.</p>

            makes sure
            that the current lookahead symbol is consistent with what were expecting
            at this point in the ATN. You can call this anytime but ANTLR only
            generates code to check before subrules/loops and each iteration.
            <p>Implements Jim Idle's magic sync mechanism in closures and optional
            subrules. E.g.,</p>
            <pre>
            a : sync ( stuff sync )* ;
            sync : {consume to what can follow sync} ;
            </pre>
            At the start of a sub rule upon error,
            <see cref="M:Antlr4.Runtime.DefaultErrorStrategy.Sync(Antlr4.Runtime.Parser)">Sync(Parser)</see>
            performs single
            token deletion, if possible. If it can't do that, it bails on the current
            rule and uses the default error recovery, which consumes until the
            resynchronization set of the current rule.
            <p>If the sub rule is optional (
            <code>(...)?</code>
            ,
            <code>(...)*</code>
            , or block
            with an empty alternative), then the expected set includes what follows
            the subrule.</p>
            <p>During loop iteration, it consumes until it sees a token that can start a
            sub rule or what follows loop. Yes, that is pretty aggressive. We opt to
            stay in the loop as long as possible.</p>
            <p><strong>ORIGINS</strong></p>
            <p>Previous versions of ANTLR did a poor job of their recovery within loops.
            A single mismatch token or missing token would force the parser to bail
            out of the entire rules surrounding the loop. So, for rule</p>
            <pre>
            classDef : 'class' ID '{' member* '}'
            </pre>
            input with an extra token between members would force the parser to
            consume until it found the next class definition rather than the next
            member definition of the current class.
            <p>This functionality cost a little bit of effort because the parser has to
            compare token set at the start of the loop and at each iteration. If for
            some reason speed is suffering for you, you can turn off this
            functionality by simply overriding this method as a blank { }.</p>

            <remarks>
            Conjure up a missing token during error recovery.
            The recognizer attempts to recover from single missing
            symbols. But, actions might refer to that missing symbol.
            For example, x=ID {f($x);}. The action clearly assumes
            that there has been an identifier matched previously and that
            $x points at that token. If that token is missing, but
            the next token in the stream is what we want we assume that
            this token is missing and we keep going. Because we
            have to return some token to replace the missing token,
            we have to conjure one up. This method gives the user control
            over the tokens returned for missing tokens. Mostly,
            you will want to create something special for identifier
            tokens. For literals such as '{' and ',', the default
            action in the parser or tree parser works. It simply creates
            a CommonToken of the appropriate type. The text will be the token.
            If you change what tokens must be created by the lexer,
            override this method to create the appropriate tokens.

            <p>
            This token stream provides access to all tokens by index or when calling

            <summary>A rule invocation record for parsing.</summary>
            <remarks>
            A rule invocation record for parsing.
            Contains all of the information about the current rule not stored in the
            RuleContext. It handles parse tree children list, Any ATN state
            tracing, and the default values available for rule indications:
            start, stop, rule index, current alt number, current
            ATN state.
            Subclasses made for each rule and grammar track the parameters,
            return values, locals, and labels specific to that rule. These
            are the objects that are returned from rules.
            Note text is not an actual field of a rule return value; it is computed
            from start and stop using the input stream's toString() method.  I
            could add a ctor to this so that we can pass in and store the input
            stream, but I'm not sure we want to do that.  It would seem to be undefined
            to get the .text property anyway if the rule matches tokens from multiple
            input streams.
            I do not use getters for fields of objects that are used simply to
            group values such as this aggregate.  The getters/setters are there to
            satisfy the superclass interface.

            <summary>A rule context is a record of a single rule invocation.</summary>
            <remarks>
            A rule context is a record of a single rule invocation. It knows
            which context invoked it, if any. If there is no parent context, then
            naturally the invoking state is not valid.  The parent link
            provides a chain upwards from the current rule invocation to the root
            of the invocation tree, forming a stack. We actually carry no
            information about the rule associated with this context (except
            when parsing). We keep only the state number of the invoking state from
            the ATN submachine that invoked this. Contrast this with the s
            pointer inside ParserRuleContext that tracks the current state
            being "executed" for the current rule.
            The parent contexts are useful for computing lookahead sets and
            getting error information.
            These objects are used during parsing and prediction.
            For the special case of parsers, we use the subclass
            ParserRuleContext.

            "run-length-encoded" like compression (if you view an IntSet like
            a BitSet with runs of 0s and 1s).  Only ranges are recorded so that
            a few ints up near value 1000 don't cause massive bitsets, just two
            integer intervals.
            element values may be negative.  Useful for sets of EPSILON and EOF.
            0..9 char range is index pair ['\u0030','\u0039'].
            Multiple ranges are encoded with multiple index pairs.  Isolated
            elements are encoded with an index pair where both intervals are the same.
            The ranges are ordered and disjoint so that 2..6 appears before 101..103.

            Useful for rewriting out a buffered input token stream after doing some

            <remarks>
            Useful for rewriting out a buffered input token stream after doing some
            augmentation or other manipulations on it.
            <p>
            You can insert stuff, replace, and delete chunks. Note that the operations
            are done lazily--only if you convert the buffer to a
            <see cref="T:System.String">string</see>
            with
            <see cref="M:Antlr4.Runtime.ITokenStream.GetText">ITokenStream.GetText()</see>
            . This is very efficient because you are not
            moving data around all the time. As the buffer of tokens is converted to
            strings, the
            <see cref="M:Antlr4.Runtime.TokenStreamRewriter.GetText">GetText()</see>
            method(s) scan the input token stream and
            check to see if there is an operation at the current index. If so, the
            operation is done and then normal
            <see cref="T:System.String">string</see>
            rendering continues on the
            buffer. This is like having multiple Turing machine instruction streams
            (programs) operating on a single input tape. :)</p>
            <p>
            This rewriter makes no modifications to the token stream. It does not ask the
            stream to fill itself up nor does it advance the input cursor. The token
            stream
            <see cref="P:Antlr4.Runtime.IIntStream.Index">IIntStream.Index()</see>
            will return the same value before and
            after any
            <see cref="M:Antlr4.Runtime.TokenStreamRewriter.GetText">GetText()</see>
            call.</p>
            <p>
            The rewriter only works on tokens that you have in the buffer and ignores the
            current input cursor. If you are buffering tokens on-demand, calling
            <see cref="M:Antlr4.Runtime.TokenStreamRewriter.GetText">GetText()</see>
            halfway through the input will only do rewrites for those
            tokens in the first half of the file.</p>
            <p>
            Since the operations are done lazily at
            <see cref="M:Antlr4.Runtime.TokenStreamRewriter.GetText">GetText()</see>
            -time, operations do
            not screw up the token index values. That is, an insert operation at token
            index
            <code>i</code>
            does not change the index values for tokens
            <code>i</code>
            +1..n-1.</p>
            <p>
            Because operations never actually alter the buffer, you may always get the
            original token stream back without undoing anything. Since the instructions
            are queued up, you can easily simulate transactions and roll back any changes
            if there is an error just by removing instructions. For example,</p>
            <pre>
            CharStream input = new ANTLRFileStream("input");
            TLexer lex = new TLexer(input);
            CommonTokenStream tokens = new CommonTokenStream(lex);
            T parser = new T(tokens);
            TokenStreamRewriter rewriter = new TokenStreamRewriter(tokens);
            parser.startRule();
            </pre>
            <p>
            Then in the rules, you can execute (assuming rewriter is visible):</p>
            <pre>
            Token t,u;
            ...
            rewriter.insertAfter(t, "text to put after t");}
            rewriter.insertAfter(u, "text after u");}
            System.out.println(tokens.toString());
            </pre>
            <p>
            You can also have multiple "instruction streams" and get multiple rewrites
            from a single pass over the input. Just name the instruction streams and use
            that name again when printing the buffer. This could be useful for generating
            a C file and also its header file--all from the same buffer:</p>
            <pre>
            tokens.insertAfter("pass1", t, "text to put after t");}
            tokens.insertAfter("pass2", u, "text after u");}
            System.out.println(tokens.toString("pass1"));
            System.out.println(tokens.toString("pass2"));
            </pre>
            <p>
            If you don't use named rewrite streams, a "default" stream is used as the
            first example shows.</p>

            Represents a placeholder tag in a tree pattern. A tag can have any of the
            following forms.

            <li>
            <code>expr</code>
